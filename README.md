# rotations_and_interpolation

This week we are tying up some loose ends. We are taking a look at rotations, scaling, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors; and how to interpolate, resample, and integrate numerical data from a file.

Please work through the Jupyter Notebook. There are a few simple assignments included in there. You'll need 'data_0.txt' and 'data.txt' to get through the notebook.
